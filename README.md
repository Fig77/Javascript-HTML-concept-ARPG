<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### How To Play

* Move with your Arrow Keys. Pressing Shift will allow you to sprint (at a 2hp per sprint cost.) 

* Press A to attack your enemy. Abuse collision and their 'shortness of mind' to get through the -totally fair-
difficulty.

* Press spacebar in the lobby (AKA place where you can still die if you sprint too much.) to get access to the stat menu. You will need to spend 1 stat point after each match if you want to heal.
