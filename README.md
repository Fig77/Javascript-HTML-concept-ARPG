<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

An A-RPG concept, from a top-down perspective. Game is roguelike mode (means you start all over if you lose). Survive waves of enemies during each round in an arena.

Game will scale abruptly and a certain build my get you through more rounds.

### How To Play

* Move with your Arrow Keys. Pressing Shift will allow you to sprint (at a 2hp per sprint cost.) 

* Press A to attack your enemy. Abuse collision and their 'shortness of mind' to get through the -totally fair-
difficulty.

* Press spacebar in the lobby (AKA place where you can still die if you sprint too much.) to get access to the stat menu. You will need to spend 1 stat point after each match if you want to heal.

* After game over you can click submit for uploading score, and keep playing. Or going into the menu, and keep playing.
